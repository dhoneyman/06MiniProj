## MyDashboard 

The purpose of MyDashboard is to offer the user a customizeable landing page for their web browser. Users can search for US Stocks of their choice and have them displayed on the left hand side of the page. They can also search for news articles and have top stories displayed on the center of the page. Users are also able to set the tone of the page with a 'light mode' / 'dark mode' button on the page.
